</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>2020 was not easy by any measure. COVID-19, adapting to parenthood, rollercoaster of working at an early stage startup - it was a memorable year (though I might not remember a lot because of sleep deprivation). However, I still managed to read a few books and there were several that I would like to reflect upon. So here is an overview and I will share more details on a few books in later posts.</p>
<hr>
<p>I have read 26 books this year (a bit less than the past two years), but I will aim to read even less (maybe around 20 or so books) going forward and spent a little bit more time on the ones that I do read. I can roughly categorize my books into five categories: Work-related reading (Software engineering, Machine Learning/Data Science, Product Management, and People Management), Fiction, Real-life events/people, Parenthood (Familly psychology), and Miscellaneous. One observation I can see right at the start - I do not read fiction enough. Just one this year. I will try to fix this next year. Another issue is that I haven't read enough Machine Learning / Data Science books. I have read a lot of blog posts or articles, but that is a separate matter. I will try to address this next year too.</p>
<h1>Fiction (1)</h1>
<p><strong>1984 by George Orwell</strong> - This is one of the classics that I haven't read before and I started it with no expectations. I have also read <code>The Animal Farm</code> previously and was not impressed (maybe because I did live a bit under the soviet regime and it still echos to this day in Lithuania). However, what I found was a very relevant novel in times of <code>fake news</code> and <code>alternative facts</code>. This novel didn't feel like a stretch of the imagination. It was a very chilling realization, especially considering that there are groups of people in the 21st century that live by very different facts than scientifically accepted ones. But the most appealing idea for me in this book was that of a <code>human condition</code>. No matter how severe the punishment, no matter how negligible the odds, humans are drawn to act out their inner beliefs and disregard the dangers. It is tragic and maybe even stupid for any one single individual, but very very beneficial for humanity - no matter how small the odds, some will succeed, and that will move the entire species forward.</p>
<h1>Parenthood (3)</h1>
<p>I have started reading parenthood books last year as I was expecting my son's birth. What I didn't expect, was to find that it was mostly learning about myself. It provided me with insight into my childhood behavior. </p>
<p><strong>Hold On To Your Kids by Gordon Neufeld &amp; Gabor Mate</strong> - I have sought this book out after watching the author's (interview)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX4EFwv76Vg]. I highly recommend watching it and the book. Although the book is a bit repetitive at times and is a bit dated (it was first published in 2004) the message it carries is timeless and couldn't be more relevant today - <code>attachment</code> with our children is crucial for them to develop and for us to be able to perform our parental duties, while <code>peer orientation</code> robs our children of the secure connections they need to develop and parents of "power" to guide our children towards maturation.</p>
<p>Another book about parenting that I have read this year was  <strong>Brain Rules For Baby by John Medina</strong>. In this book, John Medina reviews research in child development and makes the connection between <code>smart</code> and <code>happy</code> kids - surprise surprise, the same behavior and methods that help children develop make them happy. Or to put it the other way around - kids need to be happy and safe for them to develop. Not an earth-shattering revelation, but just a reminder where to concentrate the effort.</p>
<p>On a related topic, I have also read a very good book on the relationship in a family where both sides want to excel not only in the relationship, but at work too - <strong>Couples that Work by Jennifer Petriglieri</strong>. Based on the authors' research, this book examines what transitions couples face in their life together, and give advice on how to go through these transitions as a couple. I've read this because having a child impacted my relationship with my wife in ways I didn't expected. And according to the author, having a child is the first of three transitions couples go through in life and to manage this successfully requires quite a big shift in mindset. It helped me understand the dynamics of our family a bit better and even </p>
<h1>Work-related (5)</h1>
<p><strong>Building Machine Learning Powered Applications by Emmanuel Ameisen</strong></p>
<p><strong>High Output Management by Andrew S. Grove</strong></p>
<p><strong>No Rules Rules by Reed Hastings &amp; Erin Meyer</strong></p>
<p><strong>Radical Candor by Kim Scott</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nature of Software Development by Ron Jeffries</strong></p>
<h1>Real-life events/people (9)</h1>
<p>This category can be further broken down to biographies about prominent people and descriptions of events. I have started reading more about prominent people and events last year and found it to be a great inspiration - a lot of the time events happen at random and we, humans, tend to overfit a lot to the patterns we perceive. It is very refreshing to see how much luck plays a role and how much perseverance helps to achieve great things.</p>
